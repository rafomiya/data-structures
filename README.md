# Data Structures

A repository with the data structures I have implemented.

So far, these are the available data structures. All of them have a brief explanation about the data structure itself and the available methods of each implementation.

- [Stack (C++)](stack-cpp/).
- [Queue (C++)](queue-cpp/).
- [LinkedList (C#)](linkedlist-csharp/).
